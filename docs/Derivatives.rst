Derivatives
===========

Pydro provides both midpoint-to-node and midpoint-and-node-to-node
:cite:`Nonomura20138` finite-difference schemes with up to tenth-order
accuracy. Additionally, variable-order methods are provided where
the order of the difference scheme used is adjusted locally at each
grid point according to an input array of orders to use at each grid
point.

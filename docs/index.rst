Welcome to Pydro's documentation!
=================================

Pydro is a collection of reconstruction schemes and other components
needed to solve systems of equations that can develop discontinuities,
such as Burgers equation, and compressible Newtonian Euler. If Numba
is available the code will be JITed for better performance.
